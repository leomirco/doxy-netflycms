For the period in which all payments have been made correctly and the Company remains fully in agreement with the Terms and Conditions, Tiledesk will make all reasonable efforts to provide the necessary support.‌

The Company agrees to send his support requests to Tiledesk through the tools prepared and communicated in the purchase order. Requests outside the channels indicated in the order will not be taken into consideration.‌

Intervention times always depend on the extent of the problem encountered and are shown below.

### How does the support work?

Tiledesk will make every reasonable effort to ensure maximum availability of the self-hosted installation infrastructure.‌

Below are the target response times for a support case based on the customer’s Enterprise Plan type and support case severity level.
