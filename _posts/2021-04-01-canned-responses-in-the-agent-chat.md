Quick responses on live chat are crucial for customer satisfaction. That’s where **canned responses** come in handy. They help agents avoid delays and save them from typing the same answer over and over again.

Canned responses are predefined responses that can be called during the chat. To use it in Tidio, you type “/” (forward slash) and follow it with a word or the first few letters of any word that is included in the response.
