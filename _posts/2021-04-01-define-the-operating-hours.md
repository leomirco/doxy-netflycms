If a customer gets in touch outside of your office hours, the Tiledesk Bot will replies with a specific message (you can customize it under Widget setting):

![Widget setting](/images/uploads/image-233.png "Widget setting")



Operating hours settings determine when the service is open. **When operating hours are enabled, agents cannot receive messages from end users outside of the scheduled work hours regardless of the availability of agents**.

If operating hours are enabled, when a customer gets in touch outside of your office hours a new **unassigned** **conversation** is created.

Access this page by going to **Settings>>Operating Hours** and then activate the opening hours with a tick.

You can customize your hours by setting your timezone which will affect all time-dependent features. Then, move to individual days and toggle them on for working days.

Adjust timing by selecting the appropriate time slot with the drop-down list.
