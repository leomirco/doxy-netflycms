Facebook changed their user policies recently, while logged in, you will need to give Facebook permission to send page messages. This integration will not work without this permission.

From there, you can also add all Facebook Pages that you want your Webhook to receive events for when people on Facebook Messenger chat with it.

For that, please follow the instructions below:

Add/reconnect Facebook Pages again and click allow/yes to all permissions.
