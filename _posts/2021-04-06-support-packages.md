Support packages are provided remotely as “Tickets” open with the support engineering staff.\
Here follows the description of the services provided in these packages.

### **Enterprise licence Support package**

### **Pro licence support package**

Pro licence support is most appropriate for small non-mission critical applications (e.g. less than 10 Agents, less then 5 bots).‌

Pro licence support is provided on a best effort, commercially reasonable basis. At this time, there is no SLA offered for case resolution.

PRO license support provides:‌

1. Documents and Knowledge bases for installation
2. Support for installation and configuration (docs only)
3. On boarding assistance for users (agents and admins)
4. Support for bug fixing within the first 30 days
5. Email only support channel

PRO license support DOES NOT provide:‌

1. Support for code modification, in any part, in any component, of the platform
2. Support for installation of third party backend components (i.e. Database)
3. Permissions for Widget **Tiledesk logo**(s) removing
4. Support for platform upgrades

While Tiledesk is provided as open source software we strictly follow the **Open-closed principle**.‌

See here: [Open-closed principle on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) ‌

Tiledesk promotes many extension points (*webhooks*, APIs, events, triggers etc.) that can be used to modify the application behaviour, get events’ notifications or data in real time, customize the User Interfaces etc.‌

We always discourage our Users and Clients to modify the application core as well as UI components. If you need to heavily modify your UI components always provide your own new features in totally new components built on top of Tiledesk APIs.‌

Modifying original Tiledesk components irreversibly affects the frequent updates released to fix important bugs, to improve performance and that add new features. Moreover, on the supported plans, our engineering team can only provide consulting on original versions of the components without incurring in extra efforts.‌

For all of the above reasons we never provide support for modified versions of our software.‌

**For the paid Support Packages, warranty always decades on modified components of the platform**.
