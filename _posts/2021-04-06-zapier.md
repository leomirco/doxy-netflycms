## When to use Zapier with Tiledesk?

\
This integration will save you time by performing repetitive tasks for you. You can automate workflows which previously had to be done manually with the connections called – Zaps.

With Tiledesk as the Trigger for Zaps, you’ll never have to export contacts collected through the Tiledesk from chat manually again.

Using Zapier, you can send Tiledesk chat ended transcripts to create new Tickets, leads and contacts or emails in your CRM or emails and much more :

### Create a lead in the CRM of your choice

With the Zapier integration, you can make sure every valuable contact will be sent to your CRM regardless of it being integrated internally in Tiledesk!

There is a wide variety of CRMs available out there. Now, you can automatically send contacts and leads to every one of them, as long as they are available in Zapier.

What is important is that it will happen automatically, as a part of your automation you use to gather the visitor data.

### Get an email notification for every incoming message

If you value each and every message you receive from your customers, you don’t want to miss on a sales opportunity and want to be extra sure you get the message no matter where you are – use the Zapier integration to be notified about each message by email right away!
