## About Chat default roles

\
By default, each Tiledesk project includes three roles: Agent, Administrator, and Owner. Each of these roles by default has standard permissions and abilities.

**Agents** can:

* Chat with customers
* View and manage active or archived chats assigned to him or to the group he belongs to (if he belongs to a department configured with a group).
* Add another teammates to a conversation assigned to him or to the group he belongs to and can forward a conversation to another teammate
* Configure personal settings
* View the contacts
* Cancel the personal account

**Administrators** have all of the default agent privileges. In addition, an administrator can:

* View all the active and archived chats
* Archive all the conversations
* Configure global and personal settings
* Invite agents
* Manage triggers, departments and groups
* Create canned responses and tags
* Install apps from the marketplace
* See the Analytics

The **owner** has all the default administrator and agent privileges. In addition, the account owner can:

* Upgrade or downgrade the account’s plan
* Delete permanently chats
* Delete permanently contacts
* Change the teammate role
