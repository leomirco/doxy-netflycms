When you’re logged into Tiledesk, you can set your status to any of the following:

* **Available**: Signifies you’re available to answer chats.
* **Unavailable**: Signifies internally to other agents that you’re away from your computer. You can still serve chat requests when your status is Unavailable.

**To manually change your status**

* To change your status once you’re already logged in, click the avatar image in the upper-left corner of the dashboard menu.

  ## **Viewing other agents online statuses**

  You can see which other agents are available by clicking **Users** in the left panel of the dashboard.
