Tags are labels that you add to chats and requests. They help you categorize and organize all customer communication in your Tiledesk account.

## Create a label

Admins and the owner can create tags to be used by all agents. To create a new tag:

Log in to the Console and go to Settings > Labels

## Add labels to chats and requests

Adding tags in Chats and Requests is very similar. All you need to do is click on the +add label link and choose the correct tag from the list.

In Chats and Requests, you will find the +add tag link at the right side of the page.
