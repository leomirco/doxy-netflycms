You can specify how incoming chat requests are automatically distributed to your agents when they are all busy or when you are out of operating hours.

Every time Tiledesk can’t assign a new incoming conversation to an agent the conversation is placed in the Unassigned queue.

There are many reasons why Tiledesk can’t assign a request to an agent, for example when no agent is available because they set their status to unavailable, or simply because the user is starting a conversation out of operating hours. There are also other reasons for a conversation to be placed in the Unassigned queue, for example the busy status of an agent (he reached the maximum chat limit).

When a conversation is placed in the Unassigned queue you have a couple of options to manage the conversation:

1. You can manually serve the conversation (assigning it to yourself or to some of your colleagues) or

2. let Tiledesk assigns it to an agent for you using the conversation department’s rules.

## Smart assign

Smart Assign is a set of automatic rules that let Tiledesk to manage assignment in an intelligent and automatic way.

To setup Smart assign options go in **Project Settings** > **Smart assign** tab

With Smart Assignment you can choose set many automatic actions on your queues management:

Set automatic assignment from the Unassigned queue to the available agents, as soon as one become available or as soon as you are out of offline hours.

Set the maximum chat limit that an agent can manage. You can set this number generally, for all agents, or you can modify this limit for each individual agent in ther profile view.
