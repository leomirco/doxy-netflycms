## **Track Agents’ Activities**

The audit log has many benefits: it allows you to securely track what agents have been doing on the system and to keep them accountable for their actions. With the audit log, you can solve potential problems by viewing what has been done on the system by a specific agent at a specific time.

## **Change Activities**

Tiledesk’s audit log allows you to record all activities performed by agents in the system, ranging from see the new conversations, to see the invitations, making changes to accounts, and more.

## **Add filters for a complete audit log**

Filters help you narrow down audit log entries and facilitate your search for the information you are interested in. Filters include agent, time period, activities.

For example, you may build an audit log that displays activities for a specific time range and an individual agent.
