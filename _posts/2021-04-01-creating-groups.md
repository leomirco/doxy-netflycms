Use groups to organize support teams.\
You can group agents based on skills and assign groups of agents to your [departments](https://reverent-panini-e2d056.netlify.app/getting_started_for_admins/creating-a-department).

To create a group of agents go to the dashboard sidebar and select **SETTINGS > USERS & GROUPS**.

Click on the “GROUPS” tab. With the “Add Group” button you can create the new group.
