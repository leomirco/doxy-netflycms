When you’re logged into Tiledesk, you can set your status to any of the following:\
• **Available**: Signifies you’re available to answer chats.\
• **Unavailable**: Signifies internally to other agents that you’re away from your computer. You can still serve chat requests when your status is Unavailable.

**To manually change your status**\
• To change your status once you’re already logged in, click the avatar image in the upper-left corner of the dashboard menu.
