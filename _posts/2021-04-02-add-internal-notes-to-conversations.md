Add internal notes to conversations and discuss customer questions behind the scenes with teammates before replying.\
Often a message needs to be seen by another member of your team. Maybe they’re better placed to answer it, or maybe you need their opinion before replying. You can add an internal note so a teammate get notified and directed to that conversation.

Also the agent can see the conversation notes from the agent chat as showed below:

If you accidentally added a note, you can easily delete with the x icon.

## When to use internal notes

Here are just a few examples of when you should discuss a conversation behind the scenes:

### Addressing issues fast

If there’s a bug you can loop in a technical teammate to get their advice. Or, if a VIP customer is about to quit, you should definitely loop in their account manager to let them know.

### Sharing ideas

Often a conversation with a customer can spark a moment of inspiration. They’ll have lots of ideas about how to use your product and what features they’d like to see next. Sometimes they’ll even have questions that will get you thinking, ‘This would make a great case study on our blog.’ You can loop in your content writer and share the idea with them right there and then.

### Identifying sales opportunities

You’ll tend to learn when a customer should be directed toward your sales team. It’s rarely as straightforward as a user requesting to “talk to someone in sales.” Usually it means picking up clues that they need help identifying the right subscription level, feature set, or custom plan to resolve their problem. You can loop your best sales person into a promising conversation and ask if they’d like the message assigned to them.
