Hi Tiledesk developers!

We just released a new tutorial, very specific to Dialogflow, that allows you to easily generate a Google Credentials file (corresponding to a Dialogflow Service Account).

With this file on hands you can connect your Client component (ex. web apps, web proxies, native apps etc.) directly to Dialogflow using [Dialogflow Client APIs](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/libraries/nodejs).

 

This tutorial is also really important to connect many Tiledesk’s components, like **chatbots web proxies**, to Dialogflow engine, keeping a seamless integration between human agents and Dialogflow’s automated agents (your chatbots).

The tutorial is available as an official Tiledesk document and you can find it in documents section of the website, in the Tutorials subsection.
